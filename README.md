# Processor-Pipelining


Step by step procedure of constructing a Parallel Pipeline Procedure using register banks (MIPS32).This repository consists of program seperately made for register bank , 3 and 4 stage pipeline and finally a processor pipeline which is made by the help of the previous three. Processor pipeline shows various steps of a pipelining structure like Instruction decode , Instruction fetch and Execution.
